          <h2><strong>5. CRYPTOCURRENCY DONATIONS</strong></h2>
          
          <h3><strong>5.1 Transaction Execution</strong></h3>
          
          <p>All cryptocurrency donations are executed through smart contracts deployed on blockchain networks. Once initiated, transactions cannot be reversed or refunded except as required by applicable law.</p>
          
          <h3><strong>5.2 Role of Give Protocol</strong></h3>
          
          <p>Give Protocol Foundation, as a not-for-profit charitable organization, connects charitable organizations with those looking to donate cryptocurrency and other assets. When we use the word &quot;you&quot; in these Terms, it refers to any user, regardless of whether you are a donor or using the Services on behalf of a charitable organization, while if we use one of those specific terms, it only applies to that category of user.</p>
          
          <p>Where applicable take steps to confirm each potential charitable organization is a registered nonprofit organization. However, each donor must make its own determinations that an organization available through our Service is suitable for such donor. Give Protocol is only responsible for connecting organizations and donors, and is not responsible for the use of any donations.</p>
          
          <h3><strong>5.3 Transaction Fees</strong></h3>
          
          <p>You are responsible for all transaction fees associated with donations, including:</p>

            <li>- Blockchain network fees (gas fees)</li>
            <li>- Any platform fees as disclosed prior to transaction execution</li>
            <li>- Any currency conversion fees</li>
