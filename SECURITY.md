## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Do NOT Create a Public GitHub Issue

**If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public GitHub issue.** Public disclosure puts the entire community at risk and violates responsible disclosure practices.

### How to Report Safely

**Email:** security@giveprotocol.io

**Include in your report:**

1. **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., smart contract bug, authentication bypass, XSS, data leak)
2. **Location** (e.g., which file, function, or contract)
3. **Description** – clear explanation of the issue
4. **Reproduction steps** – how to reproduce the vulnerability
5. **Impact** – what could an attacker do?
6. **Proof of Concept** (optional but helpful) – code snippet or screenshot
7. **Your contact information** – name, email, optionally PGP key

### Example Report

```

2. **We Investigate** → Assessment within **3-5 business days**
3. **We Fix** → Development of patch (timeline depends on severity)
4. **We Test** → Testnet deployment and review
5. **We Deploy** → Mainnet patch + public disclosure

### Severity Levels & Response Times

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Example |

| **High** 🟠 | Significant risk to data or funds, or widespread service disruption | 3-5 days | Authentication bypass, data exposure, DOS attacks |
| **Medium** 🟡 | Limited impact, requires specific conditions or user action | 7-14 days | XSS vulnerability, information disclosure |
| **Low** 🟢 | Minimal impact, low likelihood of exploitation | 30 days | Typos in docs, non-critical logic issues |

### Disclosure & Patch Release

**For Critical/High severity:**
- We will **coordinate with you on a disclosure date**
- We typically ask for **30-60 days before public disclosure** to allow users to upgrade
- We will **credit your discovery** in our security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- You will receive a **security advisory link before public release**

**For Medium/Low severity:**
